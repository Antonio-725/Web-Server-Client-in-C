This web server and client system allow the client to request a file from the server using a specified URL. The server, upon receiving a request, fetches the file and sends it back to the client along with the HTTP response headers. The client then processes the response, displaying the file contents if the request was successful.

Here's a brief description of how the system works:

1. **Client Request**: The client sends an HTTP GET request to the server, specifying the URL of the file it wants to retrieve.

2. **Server Response**: The server receives the request, parses the URL to extract the hostname and path, and establishes a connection with the client.

3. **Fetching File**: The server fetches the requested file based on the provided URL. If the file is found, it reads its contents and prepares to send it to the client.

4. **Sending Response**: The server constructs an HTTP response containing the file contents along with the appropriate response headers, such as HTTP status code, content length, and content type. It then sends this response back to the client.

5. **Client Processing**: The client receives the server's response, including the file contents and response headers. It processes the response, displaying the file contents if the request was successful.

6. **Error Handling**: If the requested file is not found or there is an error during the process, the server responds with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 404 Not Found). The client handles these error responses accordingly.

7. **Performance**: To measure the performance of the server-client communication, the system calculates and prints the round-trip time (RTT) for each request, providing insights into the network latency and overall performance of the system.

Overall, this web server and client system allow for efficient retrieval and display of files over the network, providing a basic framework for web-based file transfer.
