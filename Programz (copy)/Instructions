To compile and run the client and server programs, follow these steps:

### Server Compilation and Execution

1. Compile the Server:
   gcc -o Server Server.c
   

2. **Run the Server:**
  
   sudo ./Server 80 ( Replace `80` with the port number you want to use for the server.)



### Client Compilation and Execution

1. **Compile the Client:**
  gcc -o Client Client.c -Wno-format-truncation
   

2. **Run the Client:**
   ./Client -p localhost 80 (Replace `localhost` with the hostname or IP address of the server, and `80` with the port number the server is listening on)


### Note:
- You may need to use `sudo` to run the server if you're binding to a port below 1024.
- Ensure that there are no other services running on port 80 to avoid conflicts.
- Make sure to use the correct hostname or IP address for the client to connect to the server.
- Adjust the firewall settings if necessary to allow communication on the specified port.
